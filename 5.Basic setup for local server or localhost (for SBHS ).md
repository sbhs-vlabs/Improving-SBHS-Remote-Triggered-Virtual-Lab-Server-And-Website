Basic setup for local server or localhost (for SBHS )
------------------------------------------------------
---
Before setting up local server requirements must be installed with the following ``pip`` packages: 

     pip install django-taggit
     pip install pyserial
     pip install --upgrade setuptools
     sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

***Step 1***. Go to settings.py python fie inside sbhs_server folder.

     path/to/directory/sbhs_server/settings.py

***Step 2***.
* For development mode:	
```	
     DEBUG = True
```
* For live server mode:
```
     DEBUG = is_production 
```
***Step 3***. By the above two steps our local SBHS website will be up locally. To work with sbhs        board locally our ip must be updated in the `settings.py` python file, i.e.

  
     if not DEBUG:
           ALLOWED_HOSTS = [“NETWORK'S IP”,]

***Step 4***. The `BASE_URL`  must be changed for debugging mode to the current network’s IP address with port  in order to have a complete working of SBHS.


     BASE_URL= “http://00.000.000.00: 8080”

***Step 5***. In `settings.py` all the execution will be under `is_production` as we are currently working offline or locally as a debugger so changes are needed, i.e:


     if not is_production: must be changed to if is_production:

**NOTE:** In our case step 5 changes should be done at line (166) . *`is_production`* is defined as a debugger mode or for testing purpose and the other is for live server.
