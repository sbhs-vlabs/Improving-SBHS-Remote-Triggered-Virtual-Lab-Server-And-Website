##  Block diagram explanation of Single Board Heater System
<br /> <br />

The following figure shows the block diagram of ‘*Single Board Heater System*’(SBHS).
*Micro-controller ATmega16* is used at the heart of the setup. The micro-controller can be
programmed with the help of an In-system programmer port(ISP) available on the board.
The setup can be connected to a computer via two serial communication ports namely
*RS232* and *USB*. A particular port can be selected by setting the jumper to its appropriate
place. The communication between PC and setup takes place via a serial to TTL interface.
The µC operates the Heater and Fan with the help of separate drivers. The driver comprises
of a power *MOSFET*. A temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature and feed to
the µC through an Instrumentation Amplifier. Some required parameter values are also
displayed along with some LED indications.
