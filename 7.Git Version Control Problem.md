<br/> 

*Following are the error message shown on the Terminal when `pull_clients.sh` file is executed:*

```
╭─vlabs@vlabs-Veriton-Series  ~/sbhs_vlabs/sbhs  ‹master›
╰─$ ./pull_clients.sh
/home/vlabs/sbhs_vlabs/sbhs/client_static
fatal: Not a git repository: ../.git/modules/client_static

```
<br />

*Following steps should be performed to overcome the above occurring errors:* 

<br/>

***1.** During login to the live server use the following command to the terminal* 

*`ssh -X vlabs@10.102.152.15 -p 6498` instead of just using `ssh vlabs@10.102.152.15 -p  6498`*

***2.** Now launch the firefox from the terminal `(firefox internet.iitb.ac.in)` Note that if you do not use the **`-X`** you will get **`Error: no display specified`** because of the reason that Firefox is being launched, but there is no X server (GUI) running on the remote host.*

*Also,note that these steps are for connecting the LDAP [**https://internet.iitb.ac.in/**](https://internet.iitb.ac.in/) as i have the only choice to give the internet acess to the server,A permanent solution to this probelem is to provide the direct internet acess to the live server.*
