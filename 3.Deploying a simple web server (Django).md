# Deploying a simple web server (*Django*)
---

<br />

+ For deployment of web server in django the following steps are used in linux operating system : 

 *1. Firstly create a django project using following command in the terminal of linux.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `$ django-admin startproject ProjectName`

 *This will create a ProjectName directory in your current directory.* <br/>
 *Let’s look at what startproject created:*

 ```  
                         ProjectName/
                             manage.py
                             ProjectName/
                                 __init__.py
                                 settings.py
                                 urls.py
                                 wsgi.py
 ```
+ The outer `ProjectName/` root directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django.

+ `manage.py` is  a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.

+ The inner `ProjectName/` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it .

+ `ProjectName/__init__.py` is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

+ `ProjectName/settings.py` Settings/configuration for this Django project. 

+ `ProjectName/urls.py` The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.

+ `ProjectName/wsgi.py` an entry-point for Web Server Gateway Interface-compatible web servers to serve your project.

 *2. To verify if your Django project works. Change into the outer ProjectName  directory and run the following command in terminal.*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `$ python manage.py runserver`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*After execution of the above command you will see following output:*
```
        Performing system checks...
	        System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
	        You have unapplied migrations; your app may not work properly until they are applied.
	        Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
	        June 25, 2016 - 20:32:56
	        Django version 1.6, using settings 'ProjectName.settings'
	        Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	        Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

*Now the server’s running, visit [**http://127.0.0.1:8000/** ]( http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) with your Web browser. **You’ll see a “Welcome to Django” page, in pleasant, light-blue pastel. It worked!.***

*You can also change the port of the web server while running the server by changing the command as follows:* <br />

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        `$ python manage.py runserver 8080`


***Now the server’s running but its address will be [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)***

*3.  For more clarifications to django project and apps we have made a simple django login and registration server.*

## Django registration and login page

- The server is basically consists of the following part:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ** 1.** It basically consists of simple project(myapp) and a app(login) inside it.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **2.** Inside the login app there is another app  named templates which consists of Registration directory, home(a html file for home page).*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **3.** The registration directory basically consists of user details.*


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* **4.** The source code for the above project can be found to the following specified link:*
