Virtual Environment
===================
---
The main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.

## Creating Virtual Environment
---

***Following are the steps to create virtual environment:*** 

***Step 1.*** Install `virtualenv`(In linux use command `pip install virtualenv`).Virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a python project would need.

***Step 2.*** Install `virtualenvwrapper`(In linux use command `pip install virtualenvwrapper`).

***Step 3.*** Use the following command `export WORKON_HOME=~/VirtualEnv` this will make a folder named *VirtualEnv* (by default in linux : `/home/username/VirtualEnv`).This folder will contain all the virtual environment requirments at a single place.

***Step 4.*** If there is a error in third step, go to the */usr/local/bin/* open the terminal and use step 2 command and install virtualenvwrapper here also.
